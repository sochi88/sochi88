This folder contains a collection of different videogames I've worked on with different teams.

Cats vs the Universe
  I worked on this with a team of 4 during a video game development course I took in 2017. It took
  us 4 months and a half to complete. I worked on primarily on the intro animation and the art. 

Faculty Game Jam 2019
  The CS faculty hosted a game jam and I worked on this alongside another friend. The theme was
  education and so we settled on a game geared towards educating children about sea turtles. We
  won 2nd place with it.

Puzzle Game
  A very small puzzle game I did as part of my very first video games with unity.

Global Game Jams
  I've participated in two global game jams in 2019 and 2020. Here are the link to the games in the
  official website.
